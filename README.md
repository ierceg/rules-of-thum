My software development rules of thumb
(maybe the first should be "Always use a spellchecker considering I mistyped the name of the repo)

* Innovate in solution domain with a known problem domain, innovate in problem domain with a known solution domain (unless of course a novel solution domain drives the problem domain)
* If you are generating code that will be checked in, you have failed.
* In a team greater than one, all code should be reviewed. In a team of one, all code should be reviewed as well!
* If possible collect today's unusable data for the sake of future algorithms.
* Working software is rarealy if ever a product.
* Use the tools. If you are going to follow any fashion then follow fashion in the tools, not in the development processes, frameworks or similar.
